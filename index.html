					  <h2>Let Me Break the Ice ☕</h2>
					</header>
				  
					<p>
					  I began my academic journey in <strong>Electronics and Communication Engineering</strong>,
					  initially driven by my family’s economic circumstances. What started as a practical
					  decision soon turned into a genuine passion as I discovered my interest in programming,
					  problem-solving, and analytical thinking alongside my core engineering foundation.
					</p>
				  
					<p>
					  As my curiosity grew, I expanded beyond traditional ECE coursework and explored
					  diverse domains such as web development, software engineering, data analysis,
					  Python-based automation, and database management. This hands-on exploration helped
					  me bridge engineering principles with real-world, data-driven applications.
					</p>
				  
					<p>
					  Today, I’m proficient in tools such as <strong>Python, SQL, and Tableau</strong>, and I
					  strongly believe in the power of data and technology to create meaningful impact
					  across business and society.
					</p>
				  
					<p>
					  Looking back, I’m proud of how this journey has shaped me  both professionally and
					  personally. I’m always happy to connect for project collaborations, networking, or
					  even a passionate discussion on why <strong>Real Madrid is the greatest club in
					  football history</strong>. ⚽👑  
					  <br><strong>Hala Madrid!</strong>

					  <h2>Beyond Academics</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
					  Beyond academics and analytics, I actively engage in sports, fitness, and
					  cultural leadership that help me stay disciplined, creative, and balanced.
					</p>
					<p>
					  I am a competitive badminton player, an active swimmer, and enjoy skating as
					  part of my fitness routine. I regularly work out at the gym, focusing on both
					  physical strength and mental resilience.
					</p>
					<p>
					  Dance is one of my strongest passions : I am a trained dancer and currently
					  serve as the Dance Lead of the UTD ISA Dance Team, where I lead performances,
					  coordinate practice sessions, and mentor team members for cultural events.
					</p>
					<p>
					  I am also an extracurricular activist, actively involved in university
					  sports and cultural initiatives that promote leadership, teamwork, and
					  community engagement.
